The Slayer-Exciter circuit is one of the simplist plasma-generating circuits to build. The arc in the image below is about 1cm, and it can be run for about 10 minutes before the transistor burns out. I first built the circuit showed in this folder in January 2020, and have since attempted to scale up to SSTCs and DRSSTCs.
