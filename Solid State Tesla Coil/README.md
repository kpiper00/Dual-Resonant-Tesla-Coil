I originally intended to use the Solid State Tesla Coil as a bridge between Slayer-Exciter Circuits and DRSSTCs, due to that they do not necessarily need a printed circuit board. After catastrophic failure of the bridge circuit on my first test, I decided to continue directly to working on developing a DRSSTC.
