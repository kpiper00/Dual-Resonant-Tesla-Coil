DRSSTCs are the most powerful form of Tesla Coil, and use the Universal Driver developed by several users. I have assembled the UD2.7C, which was last modified by LoneOceans (https://www.loneoceans.com/labs/ud27/). My next step in this project is to assemble the Bridge circuit. This is currently on hold due to exorbiant prices for suitable transistors (due to the semiconductor shortage), and the high risk of burning out transistors during initial testing.
