# Tesla Coil Development

Progress on my construction of a Dual Resonant Solid State Tesla Coil (DRSSTC).

Analog Electronics, Arduino

In January 2020, I first assembled a Slayer-Exciter Tesla Coil. Since then I've continued to work towards a more reliable DRSSTC. This repository documents my progress, including the initial Slayer-Exciter Circuit and an attempt at a Solid State Tesla Coil.
